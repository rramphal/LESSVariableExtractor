#LESS Variable Extractor

This is a Sublime Text plugin to loop through every line of a LESS file and extract all CSS values out into LESS variables. The idea is that once the variables have been prepended, the user can create a New View into File side-by side to rename the variables to be more meaningful.

The source code here is annotated to help someone with familiarity with JavaScript and some Ruby, but new to Python as well as to Sublime Text plugin development, to get up and running.
